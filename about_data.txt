About New York City 
I chose New York city as my data extract for P3-Data Wrangling via OpenStreetMap. Though I have never been there but I chose this city as I am in completely awe of that place due to its cosmopolitan,bustling hive of activity nature and also it being melting pot of diverse cultures/ethnicity. It is also home to various famous places like central park, times square,statue of liberty, madison square garden and metropolitan Museum of Art which have been captured beautifully in many popular movies and shows. Also about "The Big Apple", I have read that it's a shopper’s paradise and is famous for its multi cuisine nature which excites me as a future traveller.

So for these reasons I chose New York City as my data set.
